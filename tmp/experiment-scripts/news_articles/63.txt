The groups hope Adidas signs onto the Pay Your Workers labor agreement, which advocates for garment worker pay and the right to organize."In the wake of several scandals, it seems like it would be a great thing for them to turn over a new leaf," said a member of The Yes Men identified as Mike Bonanno.Two of the faked press releases claimed Adidas was launching new clothing called REALITYWEAR from celebrities Pharrell Williams, Bad Bunny and Philllllthy. The hoax release announcing the Berlin Fashion Week debut on Jan. 16 claimed it was part of a push for a renewed focus on workers' rights and material sourcing.Adidas outlines its stance on workers' rights on a "Workplace Standards" page dedicated to the issue, spelling out its code of conduct for worker health, safety, pay and "responsible sourcing."The Guardian first reported that The Yes Men were behind the campaign.The multi-layered Yes Men campaign also referenced the now-ended partnership with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West who has come under fire in recent months for anti-Semitic statements, and included a "response" from the company, providing fabricated responses to points raised in the first releases.— CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge and Jessica Golden contributed reportingTVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT | ETListenTVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT | ETListenSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesSelect ShoppingClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
