China will have to adjust its social, economic, defense and foreign policies," said demographer Yi Fuxian.He added that the country's shrinking labour force and downturn in manufacturing heft would further exacerbate high prices and high inflation in the United States and Europe.Kang Yi, head of the national statistics bureau, told reporters that people should not worry about the decline in population as "overall labour supply still exceeds demand".China's birth rate last year was just 6.77 births per 1,000 people, down from a rate of 7.52 births in 2021 and marking the lowest birth rate on record.The number of Chinese women of childbearing age, which the government defines as 25 to 35, fell by about 4 million, Kang said.[1/5] An elderly person holds a child near lanterns decorating a shop ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year, in Beijing, China, January 15, 2023. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang12345The death rate, the highest since 1974 during the Cultural Revolution, was 7.37 deaths per 1,000 people, which compares with rate of 7.18 deaths in 2021.ONE-CHILD POLICY IMPACTMuch of the demographic downturn is the result of China's one-child policy imposed between 1980 and 2015 as well as sky-high education costs that have put many Chinese off having more than one child or even having any at all.The data was the top trending topic on Chinese social media after the figures were released on Tuesday. One hashtag,"#Is it really important to have offspring?" had hundreds of millions of hits."The fundamental reason why women do not want to have children lies not in themselves, but in the failure of society and men to take up the responsibility of raising children. For women who give birth this leads to a serious decline in their quality of life and spiritual life," posted one netizen with the username Joyful Ned.China's stringent zero-COVID policies that were in place for three years have caused further damage to the country's demographic outlook, population experts have said.Local governments have since 2021 rolled out measures to encourage people to have more babies, including tax deductions, longer maternity leave and housing subsidies. President Xi Jinping also said in October the government would enact further supportive policies.The measures so far, however, have done little to arrest the long-term trend.Online searches for baby strollers on China's Baidu search engine dropped 17% in 2022 and are down 41% since 2018, while searches for baby bottles are down more than a third since 2018. In contrast, searches for elderly care homes surged eight-fold last year.The reverse is playing out in India, where Google Trends shows a 15% year-on-year increase in searches for baby bottles in 2022, while searches for cribs rose almost five-fold.Reuters GraphicsReporting by Albee Zhang in Beijing and Farah Master in Hong Kong; Additional reporting by Kevin Yao and Ella Cao in Beijing; Editing by Edwina GibbsOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read NextChargedcategoryIndonesia close to EV deals with BYD Group and Tesla - minister, article with image5:56 AM UTCGalleryMacro MatterscategoryChina's 2022 economic growth one of the worst on record, post-pandemic policy faces test, article with gallery6:25 AM UTCBusinesscategoryAnalysis: Airlines face hurdles to cashing in on China re-opening, article with image1:06 AM UTCGalleryChinacategoryFactbox: How China is seeking to boost its falling birth rate, article with gallery6:11 AM UTCChinaRenault sales fall for 4th straight year, article with imageBusinesscategory · January 17, 2023 · 7:57 AM UTCThe Renault group on Tuesday said sales at its flagship brand fell for a fourth consecutive year in 2022 to 1,466,729 units excluding Russia, a 9.4% decline from 2021.GalleryChinacategoryChina's Lunar New Year travel offers spark of economic rebound from COVID crunch, article with gallery8:03 AM UTCMarketscategoryMorning Bid: Ugly duckling, article with image5:45 AM UTCMacro MatterscategoryChina's 2022 property investment falls for first time since 1999, article with image2:09 AM UTCWorldcategoryChinese foreign ministry welcomes visit by U.S. Secretary Blinken, article with image9:06 AM UTC .
