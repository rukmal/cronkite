(John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune)The city’s first “You Name a Snowplow” contest started its second phase Sunday, allowing residents to vote for their favorite names among the finalists.The city’s Department of Streets and Sanitation initially launched the contest Dec. 16 to name six snowplows — one for each snow district — in its fleet of almost 300 baby-blue “Snow Fighting Trucks.” Entries were submitted at chicagoshovels.org through Jan. 6. Of those, 50 finalists were chosen by the department staff.AdvertisementResidents have until Jan. 31 to vote for six of the 50 finalists. The six names with the most votes will be featured on city snowplows, which can be tracked in real time on the plow tracker.Snowplow-naming contests have been popular in other cities and states, which have used them to raise awareness for winter driving safety and to recognize employees who pilot the vehicles.AdvertisementChicagoans can vote online on the Department of Streets and Sanitation website.
