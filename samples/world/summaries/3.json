Soldiers patrol the scene after a Palestinian was shot and killed following an alleged attempted attack on an Israeli, next to Sde Efraim farm in the West Bank, Saturday, January 21, 2023. (AP Photo/Mahmoud Illean) A Palestinian man who allegedly attempted to attack an Israeli at an illegal settlement outpost farm in the northern West Bank was shot and killed on Saturday morning, according to the military. The Israel Defense Forces said the man entered the Sde Ephraim Farm outpost by car and tried to stab an Israeli man before he was shot dead by an armed Israeli civilian. Surveillance camera footage showed the alleged Palestinian attacker running after an Israeli man who at one point turned around and shot him dead. Images from the scene showed the Palestinian grasping what appeared to be a screwdriver. The Palestinian killed Saturday was named by the Palestinian Authority Health Ministry as 42-year-old Tariq Odeh Youssef Maali.

Settlers from the outpost have clashed with local Palestinians in the area in the past. In 2021, an unarmed Palestinian man was shot and killed after entering the outpost and attempting to break into a home. The incident came amid heightened tensions as Israel has been conducting an ongoing anti-terror offensive in the West Bank, to deal with a series of Palestinian attacks that killed 31 people in 2022. The IDF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operation has netted more than 2,500 arrests in near-nightly raids. It also left 171 Palestinians dead in 2022, and another 18 since the beginning of the year, many of them while carrying out attacks or during clashes with security forces, though some were uninvolved civilians.
