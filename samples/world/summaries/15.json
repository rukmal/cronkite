King Charles III will be crowned on May 6. Henry Nicholls/WPA Pool/Getty Images London CNN \u2014 Buckingham Palace on Saturday revealed details of King Charles III\u2019s coronation, set to be less extravagant than his mother\u2019s ceremony 70 years ago, in a reflection of the cost-of-living crisis many Britons are enduring. Three days of celebrations will take place, with the coronation on Saturday May 6, a \u201cCoronation Big Lunch\u201d and \u201cCoronation Concert\u201d the following day, and an extra bank holiday on Monday. The public will be invited on the last day to join \u201cThe Big Help Out\u201d by volunteering in their communities. The coronation itself will be \u201ca solemn religious service, as well as an occasion for celebration and pageantry,\u201d conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the palace said. It will, the palace reiterated, \u201creflect the Monarch\u2019s role today and look towards the future, while being rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry.\u201d That line from the palace has been interpreted by experts as a hint that Charles\u2019 coronation will be different and more subdued from the one his late mother experienced seven decades ago, with a shorter ceremony and amendments to some of the feudal elements of the ritual. Queen Elizabeth\u2019s coronation was the first live televised royal event and lasted three hours. Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in Westminster Abbey on June 2, 1953. AP Charles and his wife Camilla, the Queen Consort, will arrive at Westminster Abbey in procession from Buckingham Palace, known as \u201cThe King\u2019s Procession,\u201d and return later in a larger ceremonial procession, known as \u201cThe Coronation Procession,\u201d accompanied by other members of the royal family. The King and Queen Consort, alongside members of the royal family, will then appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to conclude the day\u2019s events. At this point, the palace has not specified which members of the family will appear in the procession and on the balcony, following Prince Andrew\u2019s continued exile from public life as a result of historical sexual abuse allegations and the publication of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir which railed against his family.

The concert will be attended by a public audience composed of volunteers from the King and Queen Consort\u2019s charity affiliations as well as several thousand members of the public selected through a national ballot held by the BBC. They will watch a \u201cworld-class orchestra play interpretations of musical favorites fronted by some of the world\u2019s biggest entertainers, alongside performers from the world of dance\u2026and a selection of spoken word sequences delivered by stars of stage and screen,\u201d the palace said, adding that a line-up would be released in due course.

Well-known locations across the country will also be lit up using projections, lasers, drone displays and illuminations as part of the concert. The celebrations will conclude on the bank holiday Monday with \u201cThe Big Help Out\u201d that will aim to \u201cbring communities together and create a lasting volunteering legacy from the Coronation Weekend.\u201d To get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN\u2019s Royal News newsletter.
