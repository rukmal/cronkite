Summary:
• Zaradar proposes for Terra Classic (LUNC) and Terra (LUNA) to be leveraged for different purposes within the ecosystem due to their unique strengths and weaknesses 
• LUNC is well suited for games (metaverses), M2M payments (IOT) and other supply chain/remittance scenarios 
• LUNA is proposed to be used as a store of wealth due to its lower supply than LUNC 
• Zaradar believes LUNC could reach $1 in 20 years if his proposed measures are employed
