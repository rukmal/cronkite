PARIS/BERLIN \u2014 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron will aim to reboot their problematic relations with a big ceremony on Sunday as shared frustration over a new U.S. law helps them overcome differences. Paris and Berlin have been at odds in recent months over defense, energy and finances, as well as Scholz\u2019s controversial \u20ac200 billion package for energy price relief, which was announced last fall without previously involving the French government. These tensions culminated in Macron snubbing Scholz by canceling, in an unprecedented manner, a planned press conference with the German leader in October. Sunday\u2019s Franco-German summit, which unites both cabinets as well as a group of parliamentarians from both countries in Paris, comes also amid growing pressure from Kyiv to provide Ukrainian forces with the means to fight back against Russia\u2019s aggression. The Ukrainians want tanks, in particular Germany\u2019s Leopard 2 tanks, but they have also called on France to send Leclerc tanks. \u201cThere are some major challenges in the defense and security sector, especially when it comes to the question of how we can reduce dependency on the United States,\u201d said Anton Hofreiter, the chair of the German parliament\u2019s European Affairs Committee.

World thinks again By Matthew Kaminski Macron proposes major boost to French defense spending amid Ukraine war By Clea Caulcutt Yet, the politician from the Greens, one of the coalition partners of Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats, also emphasized that Paris and Berlin had increasingly found common ground in recent months when it comes to responding to the U.S.\u2019s multibillion-dollar green subsidy package that has raised fears of siphoning off investment from Europe. After having publicly fallen out last October, Scholz and Macron agreed on the need to respond to America\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) by pushing for more subsidies for EU industries and loosening state aid rules. \u201cI see the cooperation with France as a great chance,\u201d Hofreiter said. The gathering on Sunday takes place exactly 60 years after the signature of the Elys\u00e9e treaty that Germany\u2019s Konrad Adenauer and France\u2019s Charles de Gaulle signed in 1962 to seal the reconciliation between the two countries after World War II. Macron and Scholz will make speeches at the Sorbonne University in front of several hundred MPs, before holding a joint cabinet meeting at the Elys\u00e9e Palace. Patching up The disagreements between Paris and Berlin in recent months also appeared compounded by the obvious lack of personal affinity between the two leaders, in contrast to the public demonstrations of affection between Macron and Scholz\u2019s predecessor, Angela Merkel. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the same temperament, nor the same history. They need to tame each,\u201d said a French government adviser after a meeting late last year. But \u201cthe more they see each other, the better they understand each other,\u201d he added. Ahead of Sunday\u2019s summit, an Elys\u00e9e Palace official indicated relations had improved between Scholz and Macron. \u201cWe were able to use the [time] to work on our big goals, to achieve the best possible impetus, particularly on the European stage. So I think we are there now,\u201d said the official in a briefing with the press. French President Emmanuel Macron meets with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz | Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty images Chantal Kopf, a German Green lawmaker dealing closely with Franco-German relations noted that Sunday\u2019s celebration comes just a few days after France signed an extensive partnership deal with its southern neighbor, Spain, which copies many elements of the Franco-German treaty. \u201cThis should be seen by us as a clear signal that France wants more and closer cooperation and is also looking for other partners to take a leading role in Europe,\u201d Kopf said. She also had a poke at Scholz\u2019s ruling coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats, which often takes a long time to decide joint positions. \u201cWe as the German government must also act with more clarity and unity in decisions at the European level, in order to be able to coordinate with our closest partner France in good time,\u201d Kopf said. France has been seeking to convince its neighbor to back its plans for a robust response to the U.S.\u2019s IRA and support the creation of a sovereign fund and the loosening of EU rules on government subsidies. In a non-paper submitted to the European Commission, France called for the EU to forge ahead with a \u201crobust and rapid\u201d Made in Europe strategy. While Scholz and Macron both want the EU to temporarily relax state subsidy rules to allow faster investments in strategic areas, France also wants the creation of an EU sovereign fund to finance investments across the Continent. The fund would be partially financed with money from existing programs. However Berlin fears this would open the door to contracting more EU debt, which it firmly opposes. In the last days ahead of the summit, officials were still striving to get both parties to agree on the wording of their joint statement. But a senior German official struck an optimistic tone ahead of Sunday: \u201cI firmly believe that we will find very good results that will create a strong momentum,\u201d he said. Sunday vibe But some last-minute difficulties may mar Macron\u2019s staging of the rekindling of the Franco-German friendship. Though the Elys\u00e9e Palace has announced that 300 German and French MPs would gather to listen to the leaders at the Sorbonne, the tally wasn\u2019t quite there on Friday. While over 120 German lawmakers have traveled to Paris to attend the meeting, only 71 French MPs have said they will turn up, according to a National Assembly roll call. \u201cIt\u2019s on a Sunday, which is a pain for both the French and the Germans, but it is also a season when [French] lawmakers tend to attend local new year\u2019s ceremonies in their constituencies,\u201d said a French official working at the National Assembly. \u201cSo we are doing the rounds and drumming up support,\u201d he added. If confirmed, the lack of enthusiasm from French MPs would be an embarrassment for the French government, after Paris signaled its disapproval in October when they learned that several German ministers were planning to skip a planned joint cabinet meeting. For the 55th anniversary of the Elys\u00e9e treaty, France also put up a poor showing compared to Germany. The French National Assembly was three-quarters empty for the celebrations, while the French were welcomed by Merkel and a full house in Berlin. More from ...
