After all, we haven't seen our families for so long,\" a 30-year-old surnamed Li told Reuters at Beijing's West railway station.But for others, the holiday is a reminder of lost loved ones.Gu Bei, a writer from Shanghai, said on the Weibo social media platform that she had been waiting nearly two weeks to have her mother cremated and that the funeral home could not tell her when the service would be scheduled.China's internet regulator said this week it would censor any \"fake information\" about the spread of the virus that could cause \"gloomy\" sentiment during Lunar New Year festivities.[1/4] Travellers wait for their trains at Hangzhou East railway station during the Spring Festival travel rush ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China January 20, 2023.

Then let me mourn my mother now,\" Gu said in her post, which did not specify her mother's cause of death.Spending by funeral homes on items from body bags to cremation ovens has risen in many provinces, documents show, one of several indications of COVID's deadly toll.China has said nearly 60,000 people with COVID died in hospital between Dec. 8 and Jan. 12. However, that toll excludes those who died at home, and some doctors have said they are discouraged from putting COVID on death certificates.PENT-UP DEMANDPresident Xi Jinping said this week that he was concerned about an influx of travellers to rural areas with weak medical systems, and that protecting the elderly - many of whom are not fully vaccinated - was a top priority.The World Health Organization's immunisation director, Kate O'Brien, praised China on Friday for making quick progress on vaccinating older people with COVID shots and boosters since lifting anti-virus controls last month.However, she added that some elderly people found it \"difficult\" to understand changes in its vaccination policy since they had previously been advised not to seek protection.A WHO report on Thursday said China reported a large jump in COVID hospitalisations in the week through Jan. 15, to the highest since the pandemic began. Hospitalisations rose by 70% on the previous week to 63,307, according to the WHO, citing data submitted by Beijing.But in a news conference on Thursday, health officials said the number of COVID patients reporting to hospital had peaked with more than 40% fewer people being treated with critical conditions on Jan. 17 compared with a peak on Jan. 5.While China's reopening has been chaotic, investors are hopeful that it will help revive its $17 trillion economy, placing bets that have lifted Chinese stocks and its yuan currency to multi-month highs.\"Markets widely anticipate a surge of pent-up demand will be unleashed from the reopening of China's economy,\" Nomura analysts said in a note.They cautioned that a fall in household wealth and a surge in youth unemployment, a hangover from years of lockdowns and travel curbs, may temper the rebound.While international flights are in short supply, Chinese tourists, a much-missed mainstay of the world's retail and travel industry, are starting to travel again.Malls from Macau to Bangkok are aiming to lure them in with red lantern displays and special dances to mark the Year of the Rabbit - and steep discounts.Chinese spending on travel had grown to $255 billion in 2019, accounting for 33% of spending in the global luxury personal goods market, according to estimates from the Bain consultancy.Reporting by Liz Lee, Alessandro Diviggiano, Bernard Orr and the Beijing newsroom Writing by John Geddie and Frances Kerry Editing by Robert Birsel and Chizu NomiyamaOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read NextChinacategoryChina says COVID outbreak has infected 80% of population, article with imageJanuary 21, 2023MarketscategoryAmazon's AWS to invest $35 billion in Virginia, article with imageJanuary 21, 2023GalleryBusinesscategoryYellen says setting price caps on Russian refined oil products 'complicated', article with galleryJanuary 21, 2023MarketscategoryGerman finance minister warns against quick decoupling from China, article with image12:04 AM UTC .
