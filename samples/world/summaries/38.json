SB 147 is a proposed Texas law that would ban governments, businesses and citizens of China, Iran, North Korea and Russia from buying real estate in Texas. \"I don't even recognize this country anymore,\" said one protestor. \"This is discrimination, okay?\" said another. Fort Bend County Judge KP George even attended the rally, speaking out against the proposed bill. \"If you see injustice happening, it is important to stand up and say this is not okay,\" George said. \"That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d George, who leads one of the nation's most diverse counties, said they\u2019re mostly concerned about residents who may still have green cards. \u201cMake it fair for all foreign people,\" said a rally attendee. \ud83d\udd08Sound up \ud83d\udd08Things got a tad tense during a rally AGAINST #SB147 which would ban governments, businesses + citizens of China, Iran, North Korea and Russia from buying land in Texas.

In fact, Eberle believes they may be supportive. \"Because they don\u2019t want those countries that they have escaped from getting more of a stranglehold or foothold in America,\u201d said Eberle. Those against the bill said it's un-American. \"This is about freedom and dignity in my opinion,\u201d said George. Sen. Kolkhorst said in a statement that this is a national security issue and that foreign entities could still lease land or other properties if SB 147 passes. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has already said he intends to sign it.
