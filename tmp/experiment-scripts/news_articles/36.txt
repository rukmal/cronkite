Updated: 7:03 PM EST Jan 16, 2023 Janice Limon Social Media Executive Producer More than 200 Upstate workers were informed on Monday they will soon be out of a job.The Timken Company notified about 225 people who work at its bearings facility in Gaffney that the plant will be closing and gradually winding down operations by the end of the year, according to Scott Schroeder, the company's media relations director. The plant, which makes roller bearings, is located on Timken Road, off Morgan Drive, near Old Georgia Highway."It’s just a sad day in Gaffney and Cherokee County," Cherokee County Development Board's Executive Director Jim Cook said. "Timken has been here for 50 years. “They were the first major non-textile industry to come to our county and Gaffney, I think, in the late 70s, and they’ve just really put us on the map. They diversified our economy. They’ve changed so many lives in our county. It’s like losing just a good friend.” Cook says the numbers had been dwindling, so the announcement wasn't a shock. However, he said the county as a whole had more major business and economic development announcements in the last year than it has had in the last 10 to 15 years.“We had our best year ever with job announcements and capital investment," Cook said. "Numbers are still yet to be released, but we had a really good year. At the same time, there were several industries though that were struggling, and we’re just keeping our eye on it. We’re doing the best we can. We’re trying to help those people who are being displaced by Timken closing.”Cook says they've welcomed several other major companies to the county over the years, like DHL, Dollar Tree and Milliken.He says they're working to bring more companies into the county.“Right now, we’re working several projects, so with the widening of 85 in Cherokee County and our growth in the Upstate, business all along the Upstate, we’re going to help the people at Timken, but we’re going to get somebody back in that building,” Cook said.

He said the company is helping affected employees by offering support, benefits planning and retention and severance pay. He said they are also giving them the opportunity to apply for open positions at other Timken locations."We wanted to be transparent and provide as much time as possible so associates can plan for their future," Schroeder said. "We’re committed to providing at least 60 days' notice prior to an associate’s last day," he said.
