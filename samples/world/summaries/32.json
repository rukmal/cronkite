Drawing on current geopolitical circumstances and technological developments, Macron will request a \u20ac400 billion ($433.4 billion) investment for the 2024-2030 LPM, he announced in a Friday speech at the nation\u2019s Mont-de-Marsan Air Base in southwestern France.If enacted, that sum would reflect a 35% increase over the current 2019-2025 LPM of \u20ac295 billion, and could cover a total of \u20ac413 billion military needs, he claimed.The current 2019-2025 LPM\u2019s directive was simple: to \u201crepair our armies,\u201d Macron said. While that effort has progressed and is ongoing, the next LPM will empower France to \u201ctransform\u201d its services to more quickly respond to global threats to its territories, he added.With the proposed funds, France will strengthen and modernize its deterrence, and \u201cmassively\u201d boost its intelligence capabilities by at least 60%, including doubling the budgets of the nation\u2019s two main intel and security organizations, Macron asserted. Increased surveillance, particularly via unmanned aerial systems (UAS) is also a priority, along with doubling the capacity to counter cyber attacks.Macron also spoke of \u201chardening\u201d the military\u2019s current capabilities under the proposed plan, including transitioning France\u2019s Air Force to a 100% Rafale fighter fleet, away from the current mix of Rafales and Mirage 2000s, both built by Dassault Aviation. He did not elaborate on how that transition might occur.Other priorities include reinforcing the prowess and protection of France\u2019s frigates, the ongoing modernization of its terrestrial systems, and buttressing its air defense and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. He confirmed that France\u2019s next aircraft carrier \u2013 known as PANG for porte-avion nouvelle generation \u2013 will be built under this budget, and called for the development of new long-range guided munitions, with a twofold funding increase to do so.Macron also cited the need for France to invest in quantum technologies, and to more seamlessly integrate drone and artificial intelligence capabilities into its services. He reinforced the need for France to invest in undersea technologies that can reach depths of 6,000 meters, and announced plans to soon unveil a new \u201coverseas strategy\u201d that would support the nation\u2019s overseas territories, calling the Indo-Pacific region the primary potential theater for future conflict.In his Friday speech, the president also issued a call to France\u2019s defense industry to increase their efficiency and availability in producing new capabilities. Production cycles need to be shortened, and costs must be better controlled, he noted.Despite the considerable increase in funding over the previous law, the 2024-2030 LPM contains \u201cno luxuries, no pleasures, no comforts,\u201d Macron claimed. \u201cThere is only what is necessary.\u201dThe proposal will be sent in the near future to France\u2019s parliament, he said, ahead of congressional debates expected in March, and a vote by summer 2023.About Vivienne MachiVivienne Machi is a reporter based in Stuttgart, Germany, contributing to Defense News' European coverage.
