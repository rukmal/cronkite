According to Channel 12 news, a private proposal drawn up by MK Simcha Rothman of the far-right Religious Zionism party will be presented to lawmakers for discussion Sunday.

(AHMAD GHARABLI / AFP) The latest demonstrations come days after government officials reacted with anger and promises of swift reforms to the High Court\u2019s decision Wednesday to disqualify Shas leader Aryeh Deri as minister over his criminal convictions. The coalition is now scrambling for a way to bypass the decision and give Deri another high-ranking role. Following last week\u2019s large protest, Netanyahu brushed off the criticism at the weekly cabinet meeting and argued that the planned changes would strengthen democracy rather than hasten its end. He also maintained that the government is carrying out the will of the people. Is our work important to you?
