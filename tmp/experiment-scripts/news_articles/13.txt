However, the momentum was muted in other risk assets like stocks as investors look ahead to corporate earnings season.“There's certainly an increasing sense of optimism about 2023 as we make our way through the opening month of the year. The economic data has been kind, to say the least, which is not something we were afforded for the vast majority of the year just gone,” said Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at OANDA. “A boost in risk appetite has triggered a surge in bitcoin which spent the final weeks of last year languishing between $16,000 and $17,000. It is up more than 25% since the turn of the year, breaking back above $20,000 this morning in the process,” said the analyst in a note seen by Benzinga.Erlam said it wasn’t clear outright if it is a sign of bottoming out or a brief rebound but there are “clearly still some very bullish traders out there.”Michaël van de Poppe said that Bitcoin is trying to “break resistance” and might “seek a sweep” of the $21,600 level. He said eyes will be on the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six other currencies, in the coming days. At the time of writing, the dollar index was at 102.30. #Bitcoin trying to break resistance, might actually seek for a sweep of $21.6K.
