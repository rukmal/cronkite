(...) It consists of heavy weaponry and ammunition,\" Pynnonen told Reuters.Finland had earlier indicated it could send the German-made Leopard tanks if there were agreement among allies.Donation of the newest aid package became possible with the help of neighbouring Sweden, which agreed to help Finland quickly replace the donated equipment in case of a crisis. The two historically neutral Nordic countries are simultaneously applying to join the NATO Western military alliance NATO.The defence ministers of Finland and Sweden are to sign a Statement of Intent (SoI) on support for Ukraine in Ramstein later today, the Finnish ministry said.Under that agreement \"Finland supplies defence materiel to Ukraine, and Sweden expresses its readiness to support Finland as necessary,\" it said.The Swedish minister of defence, Pal Jonson, said the two countries \"are each other's closest allies and today's letter of intent shows that there is no predetermined limit to how this cooperation can develop\".($1 = 0.9227 euros)(Reporting by Anne Kauranen; Editing by Peter Graff) Advertisement AdvertisementTRENDINGABC NewsElizabeth Holmes bought one-way ticket to Mexico, prosecutors sayABC News\u00b73 min readThe Daily BeastNew Brett Kavanaugh Sexual Assault Allegations Revealed in Secret Sundance DocThe Daily Beast\u00b75 min readReutersRussia's Wagner chief writes to White House over new U.S. sanctionsReuters\u00b71 min readINSIDERA woman who got wasted at a Marilyn Manson concert blew up $15 million worth of property.
