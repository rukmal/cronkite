REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannZURICH, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Siemens has signed a 3 billion euro ($3.25 billion) contract to supply and service freight trains in India, the German engineering company said on Monday, the biggest locomotive deal in its history.Siemens will deliver 1,200 electric locomotives and provide servicing for 35 years under the agreement, also its biggest ever in India.The Siemens-designed, 9,000-horsepower trains with a top speed of 120 km (75 miles)/hr will be assembled in India over the next 11 years, with deliveries starting in 24 months."These new locomotives ... can replace between 500,000 to 800,000 trucks over their lifecycle," said Siemens Mobility CEO Michael Peter.The order was a big step for Siemens in India, Peter told Reuters, saying the company had previously mainly provided components and infrastructure there."India is looking for technology, better efficiency, and longer lifespan for its trains," he said in an interview. "In the past India built their own trains, but they want to increase reliability and average speeds."The deal is the latest bumper contract won by Siemens after it signed a 900 million euro deal for a new metro line in Sydney, Australia in December.Peter was confident about reaching Siemens's goal of increasing revenue at the mobility business by 6-9% this year, although this contract would mainly appear as orders in 2023. He said profit margins were in line with what he expected for rolling stock, declining to comment further.He said Siemens was also looking at other train contracts in India, the world's largest rail market with 24 million passengers travelling daily on more than 22,000 trains.The government in New Delhi wants to increase the rail network' share of freight transport to 40-45% from the current 27%, said Siemens, whose first contact in India - a London to Calcutta telegraph line - dates back to 1867.($1 = 0.9237 euros)Reporting by John Revill; editing by John StonestreetOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read NextTechnologycategoryExclusive: Renault, Geely look to bring Aramco into engine venture - sources, article with image4:15 AM UTCChargedcategoryIndonesia close to EV deals with BYD Group and Tesla - minister, article with image5:56 AM UTCAutos & TransportationcategoryChinese EV maker Xpeng joins Tesla, Seres in price cuts, article with image7:52 AM UTCGalleryMarketscategoryAnalysis: Europe boosts Russian diesel buying ahead of ban set to rock market, article with galleryJanuary 16, 2023Autos & TransportationAir finance summit tackles jet shortages amid China travel thaw, article with imageAerospace & Defensecategory · January 16, 2023China's abrupt decision to lift COVID-19 travel curbs could accelerate a global recovery in air traffic - but after widespread staff shortages, the airline industry is now struggling with a shortage of jets, financiers said on Monday.Autos & TransportationcategoryIndia's IndiGo sees 'huge pent up demand' for domestic travelJanuary 16, 2023Autos & TransportationcategoryIndustry vs. Regulator - aviation heavyweights spar in Dublin, article with imageJanuary 16, 2023Autos & TransportationcategoryIndia's Maruti Suzuki raises prices by average 1.1% across models, article with imageJanuary 16, 2023Autos & TransportationcategoryCarvana terminates more workers amid weak used car sales -WSJ, article with imageJanuary 13, 2023Site IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsOpen in new tab, opens new tabLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout ReutersOpen in new tab, opens new tabCareersOpen in new tab, opens new tabReuters News AgencyOpen in new tab, opens new tabBrand Attribution GuidelinesOpen in new tab, opens new tabReuters LeadershipOpen in new tab, opens new tabReuters Fact CheckOpen in new tab, opens new tabReuters Diversity ReportOpen in new tab, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the AppOpen in new tab, opens new tabNewslettersOpen in new tab, opens new tabInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.
