More than 300 of them are foreigners, he added.They are not the first visitors to be stranded at Machu Picchu because of civil unrest - last month, hundreds of tourists were airlifted out after being stuck there for several days.Sitting high on a mountain in the Andes, Machu Picchu is considered one of the new seven wonders of the world. It is hugely popular with tourists, with around a million people visiting every year. Some visitors arrive at Machu Picchu via the Inca Trail, which is a famous multi-day hike. In a statement, Peru's culture ministry said that those who had already bought tickets for the site would be able to use them for one month after the end of the demonstrations, or get a refund.Demonstrators in Peru are demanding fresh elections and calling for the new President, Dina Boluarte, to stand down, which she has so far refused to do. They want her left-wing predecessor, Pedro Castillo, who is in jail and facing charges of rebellion and conspiracy, to be released. Mr Castillo denies the accusations and insists that he is still Peru's legitimate leader.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Waves of visitors have been left stranded at Machu Picchu in recent weeks due to protests disrupting transportAuthorities announced on Saturday that another protester had died following demonstrations in the southern region of Puno, where police stations were set on fire.
