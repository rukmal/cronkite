Summary:
• Used car prices: steep plunge of 8.8% in 12 months
• Reasons for decline include higher interest rates, increased inventory, and unsustainable price increases
• New car inventories continue to build, potentially leading to further declines in used car prices
• Average trade-in value in December down nearly $3,000, or 11%, to $22,605
• GM is the top car seller in America, retaking the title from Toyota
• Run-up in used car prices was a major driver in the nation’s overall inflation rate
• Drop in the value of trade-ins could be a headwind on car prices by reducing what buyers are able to pay
