Supplies are finite, including with increased production.\" In the main picture, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is seen during a press conference following the tripartite meeting on January 11, 2023, in Lviv, Ukraine. The smaller image shows a Ukrainian soldier holding a U.S.-made Stinger MANPAD (man-portable air-defense system) on the frontline on December 29, 2022, in Bakhmut, Ukraine. Some have wondered how long the U.S. can continue suppling Ukraine with weapons while keeping its own stockpiles at an adequate level for defense. Photo by Stanislav Ivanov/Pierre Crom/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images Reno said the topic of supplying weapons becomes more complex \"when one considers impacts of weapons transfers on the military preparedness of providers.\" He detailed how a U.S. military division may pass weapons on to another department for training and how that unit's \"command asks whether those transfers impair their own capacity to perform.\"\"Weapons transfers from smaller NATO member armed forces\u2014Canada, Denmark, Norway\u2014cut deeper into their capabilities and readiness,\" Reno said. \"They expect the U.S. to back them.\"However, Reno added that while the \"burn rate\" of weapons in Ukraine exceeds replacement capacities, the same \"is true on the Russian side too,\" resulting in Russian President Vladimir Putin turning to Iran and North Korea for armaments.

Katz told Newsweek that while Ukraine and Russia both continue using up large amounts of weapons, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's forces have an advantage.\"The difference, I believe, is that the West\u2014especially the U.S.\u2014has much greater capacity to produce weapons than does Russia and its allies,\" Katz said. \"And since Russian weapons have relied on Western inputs, which Moscow can no longer obtain, this puts a severe limit on Russia's ability to resupply itself.\"Steven Myers, a former member of the U.S. State Department Advisory Committee on International Economic policy and the National Security Membership Committee, told Newsweek that he believes the U.S. and Western allies could eventually hit their own issues with weapon production.\"Is the West going to run out of weapons? Yes and no,\" Myers said. \"The U.S. can't keep sending weapons\u2014for example artillery shells\u2014without replenishing its stockpile. The Pentagon has been asking its contractors to ramp up production. But contractors, being sensible, are more than a little reluctant to do so without guarantees by the Pentagon for covering the capital expenses required for increasing production rate.\"In Katz's estimation, if \"the outcome of the war will be significantly determined by which side can deploy and replace the most weapons, Ukraine has the advantage\u2014so long as Western states continue to supply it.\"Spoonts credited much of Ukraine's success in the war to Western help, which he said Zelensky can likely continue to count on.\"They [Ukraine] are vulnerable in the sense that they probably could not continue the fight without the West's supplies. Negotiating with Russia, though, would not result in Ukraine continuing to exist as a country,\" Spoonts said. \"Ukraine has little choice but to fight for its survival, and the West has to continue supplying them to assure that or take most of the blame for their defeat.\"Newsweek reached out to the U.S. Department of Defense for comment.
