Investors are cautiously optimistic on the recent deluge of promising data from major economies, with inflation prints indicating that consumer price increases may be coming back to earth.

Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters told CNBC in Davos on Tuesday that he’s wary of concluding that inflation is over the hill, especially when looking at the global picture.

“Inflation is not done. We had the big energy price spike and we’re having the energy price decompression, partially, but underlying, the job market in the U.S. is still pretty strong, there are labor shortages around the world,” Winters said.
