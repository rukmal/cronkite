DAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is prompting soul-searching in neighboring Moldova about whether the country needs to shift away from its constitutionally-enshrined neutrality and lock itself into a \u201clarger alliance.\u201d When asked about potential NATO accession, Moldova\u2019s President Maia Sandu said in an interview with POLITICO the country was still weighing its next step, and whether it would require a constitutional change to do so. \u201cNow, there is a serious discussion \u2026 about our capacity to defend ourselves, whether we can do it ourselves, or whether we should be part of a larger alliance,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if we come, at some point, to the conclusion as a nation that we need to change neutrality, this should happen through a democratic process.\u201d In her response, Sandu was careful not to name-check NATO, anathema to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is already trying to destabilize Moldova\u2019s pro-EU government. Russia has warned against further military cooperation between Moldova and Western allies. You may like World\u2019s cartoonists on this week\u2019s events By POLITICO America in decline? World thinks again By Matthew Kaminski Macron proposes major boost to French defense spending amid Ukraine war By Clea Caulcutt Although Moldova is not a member of NATO, it does cooperate with the organization and contributes to the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Sandu, along with other leaders, met with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in New York during the United Nations General Assembly in September last year. Moldova\u2019s foreign minister, Nicu Popescu, attended December\u2019s NATO meeting in Bucharest \u2014 the first time a Moldovan foreign minister has participated in a NATO ministerial. At that gathering, allies reconfirmed support for Moldova, including through the provision of training for Moldovan defense forces. Neighboring NATO member Romania is also particularly keen to increase military co-operation. The most glaring obstacle to Moldova\u2019s further integration is that Russian soldiers are based inside the country, within the breakaway region of Transnistria. Still, the military calculus is becoming more pressing. Moldova has found itself perilously close to the conflict that began almost a year ago. Just last week, missile debris was again found, in the north of the country. Attacks against energy infrastructure in Ukraine also knock out power in Moldova. Moldova must perform a delicate dance: on the one hand staying true to its pro-Western and EU trajectory, on the other, not aggravating Russia to the point where it might use military force. \u2018Peaceful country\u2019 Russia has repeatedly warned Moldova about military cooperation with the West, viewing the former Soviet state as under its sphere of influence. But Sandu pushes back against any perception that Moldova\u2019s move to strengthen its defense \u2014 either by increasing its own military capacity, or by forging closer relations with other allies \u2014 is provocative, saying that Russia, not Ukraine or Moldova, is the aggressor. \u201cMoldova is a peaceful country. It\u2019s not Moldova that started a war against its neighbors,\u201d she said. \u201cRussian propaganda managed to convince part of the population that neutrality means you don\u2019t have to invest in your defense sector, that neutrality means you do nothing and you have no capacity to defend yourself, which is wrong.\u201d Sandu, a former World Bank official, was elected in 2020 on an anti-corruption drive. In June, the country will host the second meeting of the European Political Community, a Europe-wide forum for EU and non-EU countries, which first convened in Prague last year. Moldova, which under the pro-Western Sandu government is committed to joining the EU, was granted candidate status in June. While discussions on accession are ongoing, the prospect of membership is still years away. Nonetheless, the EU has upped its support for the country, allocating hundreds of millions of euros to Moldova in the form of loans and grants since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. To help facilitate Moldova\u2019s move away from Russian gas, the country\u2019s electricity grid was synchronized with the EU last year \u2014 a significant further step toward the West. Overall, Sandu says the country remains highly \u201cvulnerable,\u201d and is subject to Russian hybrid war through propaganda and misinformation. But for the moment, it\u2019s not facing military threats. The reason? Ukrainian bravery and resilience. \u201cThanks to the Ukrainians\u2019 courage and resistance, we are not facing military threats as of now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are facing a range of risks, but none of it compares to the situation in Ukraine and, and to the price that Ukrainians are paying.\u201d More from ...
