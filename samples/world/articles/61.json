We've tried to explore all those avenues.\"However, he said this report \"puts the pyridine story to bed\".MPs probing the crustacean deaths previously criticised the government-commissioned investigation for a \"lack of transparency\".The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee had expressed concerns over a lack of transparency and communication about the report, including - at the time - revealing which experts were chosen to make up the panel. The report said pathogens known to cause similar symptoms had caused crustaceans to die around the world.It said no significant pathogens were identified in the North East case but \"full molecular screening was not conducted at the time of the initial investigation\".Image caption, Fishermen, including Adrian Noble in Whitby, had described the situation as \"horrendous\"Defra chief scientific adviser Gideon Henderson said the report - by \"leading marine scientists\" - was \"unable to identify a single clear cause\" but had pointed to those more likely to explain the outbreak.Simon Clarke, Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland's Conservative MP, said it was now \"definitively clear\" the deaths were not caused by \"either capital or maintenance dredging of the Tees or anything else associated with the Teesworks site\". He said it was a \"concern\" investigators had suggested an unknown pathogen was to blame, adding: \"There is now more to be done to investigate this and also to look at the support that we can offer our local fishermen to recover.\"Fishermen, including Adrian Noble in Whitby, had described the situation with the die-offs as \"horrendous\".Redcar Conservative MP Jacob Young said that after the \"apocalyptic scenes\" seen on the beaches, \"our focus should now turn to how we help support our fisherman rebuild the industry on Teesside\". Image source, CONSERVATIVESImage caption, Ben Houchen said the shellfish deaths had been \"devastating\" for the local fishing communityTees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said the report \"made it clear\" neither dredging nor work for the freeport had played a part in the die-off.\"When I was elected, I promised former steelworkers who worked on that site that I would create a new thriving industry of the future with thousands of good-quality local jobs for local people,\" he said.\"Today, backed by the science, we can look every single one of them in the eye and say the work we are doing, in an area that means so much to so many people, is safe and is of the highest possible standard.\"He said the deaths had been \"devastating\" for the fishing community and it was essential the government supported fishermen and helped them recover. Environment Secretary Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se Coffey said the dredging had \"intensified\" as part of the work to create the freeport, and \"a finding that pyridine was to blame would have had serious repercussions\" for Teesside and potentially other places too.However, Stockton North's Labour MP Alex Cunningham said he considered the matter \"very much not closed\", calling for further investigations and Andy McDonald, Middlesbrough's Labour MP, said the report \"resolves nothing\".Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
