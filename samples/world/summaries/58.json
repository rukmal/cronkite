Russian forces have incurred heavy casualties, with Ukrainian forces holding defensive lines outside the town and continuing to strike Russian troops inside it.Before last week an estimated 500 civilians were still in Soledar although it was unclear how many remained.The convoy had reached an area close to the embattled saltmining town and the team was in the process of offloading the aid, Laerke said. \u201cRecent fighting in and around Soledar has caused widespread destruction, leaving people there in dire need of humanitarian assistance,\u201d he said, specifying that the aid was destined for civilians.Laerke said the UN hoped to be able to bring more convoys into the area, but that \u201caccess is something that needs to be assessed on a day-to-day basis\u201d. \u201cWe hope to reach them again because when aid such as food and other materials come in, of course that will run out. That lasts for a certain period of time and then we need to return.\u201dAsked whether a subsequent convoy may enter Soledar itself, he said it remained unclear. \u201cIt remains, as usual, conditioned by the security situation on the ground whether such a convoy could potentially move ahead in the future.\u201d Both sides have suffered heavy losses in Soledar. Russian control of the town would improve its forces\u2019 position as they push toward what has been their target for months, the nearby transport crossroads of Bakhmut.Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Friday its forces had taken control of Klishchiivka, a settlement south of Bakhmut. The village is about 6 miles (9km) south of Bakhmut, where units of Russia\u2019s Wagner private militia have been locked for months in a battle of attrition with Ukrainian forces. However, Ukraine reported little change in the lines of conflict in the area on Friday morning.The arrival of the convoy came as a pro-Russian official, Vladimir Rogov, said on Telegram that fighting had \u201csharply increased\u201d in the southern Ukraine region of Zaporizhzhia, where the front has been largely stagnant for months.Rogov and the Russian army said Moscow\u2019s forces had seized the village of Lobkove, about 30 miles (50km) south of the Ukrainian-held regional capital, also called Zaporizhzhia.\u201cLobkove is ours,\u201d Rogov said.He added that Russian forces had fired at Ukrainian positions with tanks, mortars and artillery in a dozen villages in the region. The Ukrainian army said on Friday that more than 20 settlements had been attacked.A day earlier Rogov had announced a \u201clocal offensive\u201d in the region near the town of Orikhiv.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportTopicsUkraineUnited NationsAidRussiaEuropenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyRussian army announces new offensive in Zaporizhzhia \u2013 as it happened6h agoRussia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 332 of the invasion21h agoGermany faces backlash over reluctance to send tanks to Ukraine8h agoZelenskiy attends memorial service for Ukraine helicopter crash victims9h agoUK offers qualified backing for tribunal to prosecute Russia\u2019s leaders1d agoUkraine frustrated as Germany holds back decision on supply of tanks1d agoLeopard 2 tanks: what are they and why does Ukraine want them?1d agoPoland could send Leopard tanks to Ukraine without German approval2d agoMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
