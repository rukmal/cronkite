Prigozhin, a billionaire oligarch who has been a long-time ally of Putin's, has used the capture of the town to discredit Russia's army.The British ministry of defense gave an update on the Wagner Group in its daily intelligence update on Friday, where it noted that the group registered as a legal entity at the end of last year, signaling its rapid expansion.

Prigozhin only admitted to founding Wagner in September 2022; in October 2022, it opened a glossy HQ in St Petersburg,\" the ministry said.\"Wagner almost certainly now commands up to 50,000 fighters in Ukraine and has become a key component of the Ukraine campaign. The registration likely aims to maximize Prigozhin's commercial gain and to further legitimize the increasingly high-profile organization.\"The group first appeared in Ukraine in 2014, when it participated in the annexation of Crimea. In January, reports emerged that said the Wagner Group was resorting to recruiting prisoners from Belarus to fight in Ukraine. In an assessment of the Russian offensive campaign on Thursday, the Institute for the Study of War said that Putin is likely increasingly siding with adversaries of Prigozhin and his group, in a possible effort to reduce the businessman's influence in Russia. The U.S.-based think tank noted that Putin on Wednesday met with St Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov\u2014\"one of Prigozhin's overt enemies\"\u2014for the first time since March 2022, to discuss the city's role in the Ukraine war.
