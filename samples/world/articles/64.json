Fighting in southern Ukraine increases as situation at nuclear plant worsensFighting in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region has enormously intensified, according to a statement released by a Russian-installed official in the area.Vladimir Rogov, the leader of the collaborationist \"We Are Together\" movement, said on messaging platform Telegram that \"the intensity of military activity ha[d] sharply increased\" in Zaporizhzhia's direction.He also added that Russian forces had managed to capture a village in the region, just 50 kilometres south of the local capital.In the meanwhile, Ukraine's energy minister said on Friday that the situation at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station was worsening because of the psychological state of its Ukrainian staff and the condition of the equipment.The plant -- Europe's largest -- has been shelled repeatedly throughout the conflict, raising fears of a possible disaster. Each side blames the other for the attacks.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, is attempting to set up a safe zone around the facility.War in Ukraine: Kyiv has accused Moscow of further militarising its Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power PlantRussia hits Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region 590 times in one weekDamaged cars are pictured at the scene where a helicopter crashed into civil infrastructure on Wednesday, in Brovary, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine.

EU countries work on 10th sanction package as Hungary blocks military aidEU countries have been working on a tenth package of sanctions on Russia and \u20ac500 million in military aid to send Ukraine, the latter of which Hungary is currently blocking, diplomatic sources told Euronews.The EU's strongest anti-Kremlin critics have already been calling for another sanction round to curb the bloc's nuclear fuel cooperation with Moscow, ban imports of Russian diamonds and reduce trade with Moscow's ally Belarus, among other measures.On Friday, senior diplomats from three middle-way countries said the next sanction package should be ready around the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.EU officials have also been seeking approval from the ministers for a seventh tranche of military aid for Ukraine, but Hungary is reportedly contesting this attempt.The Hungarian foreign ministry and the government spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on reports that Budapest was blocking that move ahead of the talks on Monday.EU diplomats told Euronews that they are hopeful to reach a deal on the military aid by Monday, which will require the unanimous approval of all 27 EU member states.Hungary's mail-in poll on Russia sanctions dismissed by BrusselsHungary is blocking release of \u20ac500 million in EU military aid to UkraineUkrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov gestures prior to the meeting of the 'Ukraine Defense Contact Group' at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

Germany denies blocking Leopard shipment to Ukraine amid Ramstein meetingGermany's newly-appointed Defence Minister Boris Pistorius on Friday denied Berlin was the last country blocking the shipment of Leopard main battle tanks to Ukraine, saying the government was ready to move swiftly on sending them if there was consensus among allies.\"There are good reasons for the (tank) deliveries and there are good reasons against,\" he said, speaking to reporters at a meeting of NATO and defence leaders from approximately 50 countries at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany. \"And in view of the entire situation of a war that has been ongoing for almost one year, all pros and cons must be weighed very carefully,\" This comes after Poland and other countries said they were waiting for Germany to lift its veto.\"The impression that has occasionally arisen, that there is a closed coalition and Germany was standing in the way, this impression is wrong,\" Pistorius said.Pressure has been building on Berlin to provide tanks to Kyiv, with Scholz's government reportedly being wary of taking steps that could be considered to make it a party to the war with Russia.Germany has become one of Ukraine's main military supporters -- overcoming a taboo rooted in the dark moments of its 20th-century history -- but it has not yet agreed to send tanks or allow other countries to send their own German-made tanks.Leopard tanks are seen as highly suitable for Ukraine as they are used widely, meaning several countries could provide some of their tanks to support Ukraine.Poland and Lithuania to send German-made Leopard tanks to UkraineUkraine war: German Leopard tanks ready in 2024, hopes fade in Dnipro, Putin says war is going wellA woman stops to look at Ukrainian flags placed in memory of those killed during the war near Maidan Square in central Kyiv, Ukraine.

CIA chief meets with Zelenskyy, US official reportsCIA Director William Burns visited Kyiv last week to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a US official said in an article published by The Washington Post, the latest example of high-level contacts between the two countries.The official, speaking anonymously, claimed that Burns met Ukrainian intelligence officials and emphasised Washington's \"continued support for Ukraine\" in the war.This is not the first time the CIA chief has briefed the Ukrainian president, speaking repeatedly before and since Russia invaded its neighbour, passing on US intelligence findings about Moscow\u2019s war plans and intentions.The CIA director, a former US ambassador to Moscow, told PBS NewsHour last month that agency analysts forecasted \"a reduced tempo and fighting between the two militaries as winter sets in.\"\"I don\u2019t underestimate for a moment the burdens, the challenges, that this war poses for Ukrainians first and foremost, but for all of us who support Ukraine,\" said Burns. \"But strategically, I think, in many ways, you know, Putin\u2019s war has thus far been a failure for Russia.\"Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes to visit the UN on invasion anniversaryUkraine war: Zelenskyy orders criminal probe into Kyiv helicopter crash and four other developments Wagner Group head Yevgeny Prigozhin, 24 December 2022.AP/Copyright 2022 The AP.

Kadyrov and Prigozhin contest Russian military leadershipChechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov on Thursday decried a ban on Russian soldiers wearing beards, joining Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in the two men's latest criticism of Russia's military leadership.Writing on Telegram, Kadyrov denounced the rules as \"a clear provocation\", claiming his Muslim-majority troops wore beards as part of their religious duty.This comes after a Wednesday interview with Viktor Sobolev, a retired lieutenant general and member of Russia's parliament, who defended the ban on beards, personal smartphones and tablets as an \"elementary part of military discipline\".Wagner boss Prigozhin called Sobolev's comments \"absurd\" and \"archaisms from the 1960s\".He has also recently attacked the Kremlin for failing to block US-owned video-sharing platform YouTube, signalling a growing rift with Putin's administration.Kadyrov and Prigozhin, whose forces in Ukraine operate with a significant degree of autonomy, have become more outspoken following Moscow's armies suffered a string of cascading defeats in the autumn.The two men have struck up a tacit alliance, amplifying each other's criticism of Moscow's military leadership and calling to escalate the war effort.Battle for Soledar: 'First Russia sends Wagner mercenaries, then highly trained paratroopers''TikTok warriors': What are Chechen fighters doing in Ukraine?Share this articleShareTweetSharesendShareTweetSharesendMoreHideShareSendShareShareShareSendShareShare You might also like Brussels, my love: The EU's reponse to the Inflation Reduction Act and the war in Ukraine Hungary is blocking release of \u20ac500 million in EU military aid to Ukraine Defence leaders convene at Ramstein amid disagreement over tanks for Ukraine MORE ABOUT UKRAINE UKRAINE RUSSIA WAR UKRAINE WAR Hot TopicLearn more about Ukraine war Hot TopicLearn more about Ukraine war Browse today's tags Sweden Germany fine (penalty) Military Turkiye (Turkey) Ukraine Leopard tank Themes My EuropeWorldBusinessSportGreenNextTravelCultureVideoProgrammes ServicesLiveBulletinAll WeatherJust inFollow usAppsMessaging appsWidgets & ServicesAfricanews Games Job offers from Jobbio More About EuronewsCommercial ServicesEU CoverageTerms and ConditionsCookie PolicyContactPress OfficeWork at EuronewsFollow us Newsletters Copyright \u00a9 euronews 2023 - English EnglishFran\u00e7aisDeutschItalianoEspa\u00f1olPortugu\u00eas\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439T\u00fcrk\u00e7e\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03acMagyar\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629ShqipRom\u00e2n\u0103\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10e3\u10da\u10d8\u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438Srpski TOP TAGS SWEDEN GERMANY FINE (PENALTY) MILITARY TURKIYE (TURKEY) My Europe World Business Sport Green Next Travel Culture Video All Programmes Here we grow: Spain Algeria Tomorrow From Qatar Coronavirus Podcasts Climate DAVOS Destination Dubai Angola 360 Depth of Field The New Uzbekistan Explore Azerbaijan Digital Garden City Nation Kerala Tourism Under the hood Invest in Brazil Crans Montana Expo 2020 Sparkle A Greener Future LiveNewslettersAll viewsBulletinJust InAll WeatherGames English Fran\u00e7ais Deutsch Italiano Espa\u00f1ol Portugu\u00eas \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 T\u00fcrk\u00e7e \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac Magyar \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 Shqip Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 Srpski", "date": "Fri, 20 Jan 2023 20:23:04 GMT", "url": "https://www.euronews.com/2023/01/20/ukraine-war-fighting-in-south-intensifies-germany-denies-blocking-tank-shipment"}
