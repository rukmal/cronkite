(Photo: AFP) NEW DELHI: Air India has been fined $37,000 for its handling of an incident in which a drunk bank executive was accused of urinating on a female passenger, Indian media have reported.The man allegedly relieved himself on the 72-year-old woman seated in business class on a Nov 26 flight from New York to New Delhi, an incident dubbed \u201cpeegate\u201d by the media. The Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation also fined Air India\u2019s director of in-flight services 300,000 rupees in addition to the carrier\u2019s penalty of three million rupees ($37,000), reports on Friday and Saturday said. The flight\u2019s pilot also had his licence suspended for three months for \u201cfailing to discharge his duties\u201d to ensure safety and discipline. The banker, Indian national Shankar Mishra, was allowed to disembark as normal when the aircraft landed in India and no immediate action was taken. The woman complained and, after the story was widely reported in the Indian media, police arrested Mishra weeks later after he went to ground and reportedly switched off his phone. The US bank Wells Fargo fired him from his job as vice-president of its Indian operations after the \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d allegations. Air India faced severe criticism for its handling of the woman\u2019s complaint and the airline\u2019s chief executive was forced to issue an apology. \u201cAir India acknowledges that it could have handled these matters better, both in the air and on the ground and is committed to taking action,\u201d chief executive Campbell Wilson said. Mishra has been refused bail. His lawyer, Ramesh Gupta, told a hearing last week that the woman, an Indian classical dancer, had in fact urinated on herself. According to Indian media, Gupta also said that, because of where she was seated, it was impossible for Mishra to have urinated on her without also doing so on another woman who has \u201cmade no such complaint\u201d. The case is the latest embarrassing incident to be reported in India\u2019s booming airline sector in recent months, including shirtless brawls and passengers having heated arguments with cabin crew. Another inebriated man was accused of urinating on the blanket of a woman on a flight from Paris to India last month but no action was taken after he issued a written apology, reports said. 27 0 Keywords Air India unruly passenger TRENDING Do you like the content of this article?
