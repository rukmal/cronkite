As of last September, his firm managed $2.2 billion, including $800 million in digital asset-related investments.Scaramucci confirmed that SkyBridge hopes to buy back a 30% stake from FTX before the middle of the year, but the timeline is uncertain as the cryptocurrency exchange's bankruptcy process unfolds, he said.(Join GMF, a chat room hosted on Refinitiv Messenger: )(Reporting by Divya Chowdhury in Davos; Additional reporting by Nishara Karuvalli Pathikkal in Bengaluru; Editing by Alexander Smith)AdvertisementTRENDING 1.
