Delta 1943, cancel takeoff clearance!” A Delta crew member then said the plane would return to the gate.About a minute later, the controller told an American crew member of a “possible pilot deviation.” The crew member responded, “The last clearance we were given, we were cleared to cross. Is that correct?” The controller responded, “You were supposed to depart Runway 4 left. You’re currently holding short of 3-1 left.”Corrected: Crossed 4L, not 4R.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating, according to an NTSB tweet.JFK is one of 35 major U.S. airports with a system that shows detailed movement of planes and vehicles on runways and taxiways, which alerts air traffic controllers of potential collisions, according to the FAA’s website.AdvertisementA spokesperson for American referred questions about the incident to the FAA.A Delta spokesperson said the plane, which was headed to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, returned to the gate, where the 145 passengers and six crew members exited. The flight was delayed overnight “due to crew resources,” and passengers were provided overnight accommodations before leaving Saturday morning, the statement said.“Delta will work with and assist aviation authorities on a full review of flight 1943 on Jan. 13 regarding a successful aborted takeoff procedure at New York-JFK,” the Delta statement said. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and delay of their travels.”American Flight 106 typically travels to London, according to the FlightAware website.Transportation, commuting and the pandemicAir travel: Airlines rebound as investigation continues | FAA ground stopAmtrak: Hundreds stranded for hours on train in rural South CarolinaTwitter ban: Temporary ban for D.C.-area bus system’s accountRoad congestion: At 155 hours, Chicago at No. 1 as traffic grows nationwideRoad safety: Deaths on U.S. roads fell slightly after record pandemic surge CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleView moreLoading...TOP STORIESThe Travel EnthusiastTravel news, guides and tips for anyone looking to get away.Love that cheap cruise price?
