December\u2019s numbers bring the total number of terror watch list arrests between the ports of entry since FY 2023 began on Oct 1. to 38.There were 98 terror watch list arrests in FY22, 15 in FY21 and just three in FY 20 at the southern border caught between ports of entry.BIDEN BLAMES GOP FOR SCORING \u2018POLITICAL POINTS\u2019 ON IMMIGRATION, AS BORDER NUMBERS HIT NEW HIGH SASABE, ARIZONA - JANUARY 23: A U.S. Border Patrol agent stands on a cliff looking for migrants that crossed the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, Sunday, January 23, 2022.

In FY 2022 there were 380 apprehensions, 157 in FY21 and 196 in FY20.While the numbers encountered by Border Patrol are a slim fraction of the more than 251,000 migrants encountered at the southern border in December, it has raised concerns from Republicans not only about some of the people trying to get into the U.S. -- but also how many may be slipping past overwhelmed Border Patrol agents.OVER QUARTER OF A MILLION MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS IN DECEMBER ALONE, CBP CONFIRMSCBP sources told Fox News this week that there were more than 70,000 gotaways in the month of December, similar to the number detected in November. There were nearly 600,000 in FY 2022.Republicans have pointed to the enormous numbers at the border, including gotaways, to dispute the claim by the Biden administration that the border is \"secure.\" The Biden administration, meanwhile, said this week that it is dealing with a mass migration that has \"gripped our hemisphere.\"TOP HOMELAND REPUBLICAN BLASTS \u2018AFTER DARK\u2019 BORDER NUMBERS RELEASE, PROMISES \u2018TIDES ARE CHANGING\u2019 \"The threats and the challenges we face are evolving, increasingly diverse, and dynamic. Yet we can meet this moment if and only if we work together,\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said at the U.S. Conference of Mayors. VideoHe also said DHS was \"executing a comprehensive strategy to secure our borders and build a safe, orderly and humane immigration system working within a broken system in desperate need of legislative reform.\"However, Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee have promised to increase scrutiny on the administration\u2019s policies in the wake of the new numbers, and taking aim at \"this refusal to enforce law and order at the border.\" \"We look forward to having Secretary Mayorkas before the Committee soon to provide answers and accountability for the significant threat these border security policies have had on our homeland security posture,\" Chairman Mark Green said in a statement on Friday.
