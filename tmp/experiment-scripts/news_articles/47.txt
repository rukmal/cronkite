In March 2022, Binance Custody secured cold-wallet insurance in Lithuania to operate an institutional-grade digital asset custody solution. Mirror accounts for more than 60% of all assets secured on Binance Custody.“We built Binance Mirror last year and have been testing it with our institutional users. User feedback has been positive, and we are happy to announce and market it officially now,” a spokesperson for Binance told Cointelegraph.It’s still unclear whether Binance plans to provide similar cold custody services to retail investors. Binance did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.Related: Bitcoin Core developer hack highlights self-custody risks: Community respondsThe news comes shortly after Binance experienced a massive drop in liquidity, with several billions of dollars worth of crypto leaving the platform in late 2022. The liquidity decline is largely attributed to the crisis among CEXs fueled by the collapse of FTX, with investors flocking to self-custody instead of storing their assets on centralized platforms.Amid the growing self-custody trend, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao admitted that centralized exchanges might no longer be necessary eventually. In November, Binance’s venture capital arm also invested in Belgian hardware wallet firm Ngrave. #Bitcoin #Cryptocurrencies #Business #Investments #Cold Storage #Binance Related News How to create an ERC token without coding, explained Opinion: 2023 is a ‘buidl’ year for crypto gaming Ukrainian pharmacies enable crypto payments via Binance Pay Cathie Wood’s ARK enters 2023 with $5.7M Coinbase stock purchase CoinFLEX attempts to hose down backlash over proposed new 3AC project Editor’s Choice BTC forming bottom akin to 2018 with one key difference: Bloomberg analyst DeFi, DAOs and NFTs: Crypto is redefining how charities raise funds Alameda wallet under liquidator control incurred $11.5M in losses: Arkham CoinFLEX attempts to hose down backlash over proposed new 3AC project BTC price cancels FTX losses — 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week Cointelegraph YouTube Subscribe Advertise with us
