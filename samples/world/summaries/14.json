Watch: https://t.co/3DOiZu6eQY pic.twitter.com/PbUfCrc5yN \u2014 churumuri (@churumuri) January 18, 2023 The first episode of the two-part series documentary, which aired on January 17, tracked Modi\u2019s early years as a politician and his rise through the ranks of the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Modi was the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat when it was gripped by communal riots that left more than 1,000 people dead \u2013 most of them Muslims. The violence erupted after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims caught fire, killing 59. The documentary revealed for the first time a United Kingdom government report into the deadly 2002 religious riots. The UK report said the events had \u201call the hallmarks of an ethnic cleansing\u201d, the documentary showed. Bilkis Bano, who is now in her forties, was five months pregnant when she was brutally gangraped in communal violence in 2002. Her rapists were released by the BJP government in Gujarat state. [File; Ajit Solanki/AP Photo] Jack Straw, who was the UK\u2019s foreign secretary at the time of the violence, was also interviewed in the documentary and said allegations against Modi undermined his reputation. \u201cThese were very serious claims \u2013 that Chief Minister Modi had played a pretty active part in pulling back the police and in tacitly encouraging the Hindu extremists,\u201d Straw said. \u201cThat was a particularly egregious example.\u201d \u201cWhat we did was establish an inquiry and have a team go to Gujarat and find out for themselves what had happened. And they produced a very thorough report,\u201d he added. The report also claimed there was widespread rape of Muslim women during the 2002 violence. It added that the riots\u2019 objective was to \u201cpurge Muslims from Hindu areas\u201d \u2013 something critics today have said has become state policy under the BJP\u2019s Hindu nationalist agenda. In 2013, the UK ended a 10-year boycott of Modi over the 2002 riots that killed three British citizens.

The second episode will be aired on January 24. India\u2019s foreign ministry on Thursday dismissed the documentary as a \u201cpropaganda piece\u201d. Foreign ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the film was meant to push a \u201cdiscredited narrative\u201d. He added that a \u201cbias\u201d, \u201clack of objectivity\u201d, and \u201ccontinuing colonial mindset\u201d is \u201cblatantly visible\u201d in it. \u201cIt makes us wonder about the purpose of this exercise and the agenda behind it, and we do not wish to dignify such efforts,\u201d he told a news conference in New Delhi. The BBC, the UK state broadcaster, said its documentary on Modi was \u201crigorously researched\u201d. \u201cThe documentary was rigorously researched according to highest editorial standards,\u201d the BBC said in a statement. \u201cA wide range of voices, witnesses and experts were approached, and we have featured a range of opinions \u2013 this includes responses from people in the BJP. We offered the Indian Government a right to reply to the matters raised in the series \u2013 it declined to respond.\u201d The UK foreign office has not commented on the issue so far. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Thursday that he did not agree with the characterisation of Modi in reply to a question in the parliament. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a polarising figure. [File: Manish Swarup/AP Photo] Accused of failing to stop the rioting, Modi denied the accusations and was exonerated in 2012 following an inquiry by India\u2019s top court. Another petition questioning his exoneration was dismissed last year. Modi has defended his handling of the worst religious violence in post-independent India and has refused to apologise. In the documentary, he told the BBC journalist that the police under him did \u201cexcellent work\u201d to control the violence in 2002. Jill McGivering, who interviewed Modi in 2002 for the BBC, recalled in the documentary: \u201cHe [Modi] struck me as a very charismatic, very powerful and quite menacing figure.\u201d Several Gujarat BJP leaders and their supporters were handed lengthy jail terms for their involvement in the violence but many of them are now out on bail and 11 men accused of gang rape were released by Modi\u2019s governing BJP party last year. Rights campaigners and officials who helped fight justice for the riot victims have had cases slapped against them, some of them jailed. Since Modi became prime minister in 2014, the country has seen increased attacks against Muslims, who form 15 percent of India\u2019s 1.4 billion population. Activists shout slogans against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a protest against the arrest of Indian activist Teesta Setalvad in Mumbai. Setalvad has since been released on bail.
