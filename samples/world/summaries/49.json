But there are objective things: the number of strike groups, the readiness of forces and means, and other points that allow us to say that today there is no threat of a full-scale ground operation and participation on the side of Russia from Belarus.\"Details: Yusov promised that \"if the situation changes, the relevant information will be shared,\" but assured that \"even in the event of a change in the situation, Ukraine is ready and has worked out all scenarios.\"\"It is in the interests of Putin and the so-called Russian Federation to escalate the issue with Belarus as much as possible. But even dictator Lukashenko doesn't really go along with it. We recently saw him leading Lavrov by the nose during a meeting, and on the one hand, he was talking about how much he loves Putin, and on the other saying that he did not see a threat from Ukraine, and that Ukraine was holding on. That is, dictator Lukashenko does not want to make suicidal actions,\" the representative of Ukrainian Chief Intelligence Directorate said.He also noted that the counter-offensive operation to liberate its lands is \"really difficult\" for Ukraine, but Ukraine can liberate its lands.Quote: \"Ukraine is liberating and will continue to liberate its territories. Believe me, there is an absolutely adequate and sober assessment of the situation, and adequate and sober tasks for the Ukrainian Defense Forces, and an understanding of our abilities. Thus, we really can liberate our lands.\"Story continuesPreviously: On 19 January, the self-proclaimed president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said that Ukraine \"pleasantly surprises\", because it does not go to provocations against Belarus, although \"it is actively pushed\".In early January, Ukrainian Chief Intelligence Directorate stated that Russia does not plan to end the war against Ukraine, but will continue offensive actions in different directions, in particular, \"leave the north or east at the same time\".Journalists fight on their own frontline.
