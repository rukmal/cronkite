Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Russia Published January 20, 2023 8:53am EST Russia's nuclear agency helps military sidestep sanctions: report Rosatom offers aid to Russian weapons manufacturers targeted by Western sanctions By Caitlin McFall | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News interview with IAEA Director General Fox News' Alex Hogan interviews IAEA Director Rafael Grossi who lays out his current nuclear concerns and responds to Moscow\u2019s claims that a Russian loss in Ukraine could trigger a \"nuclear war\". Russia\u2019s nuclear energy agency Rosatom has been working to supply Russia's military with raw materials for missile fuel, components and technology in a move to help it circumvent sanctions and continue the war in Ukraine, a report by the Washington Post found Friday.According to a letter obtained by Ukrainian intelligence from a Rosatom chief in October 2022, the agency referred to a meeting with the defense ministry and offered to supply aid to the Russian military and to weapons manufacturers that are under international sanctions.The Russian weapons manufacturers reportedly included missile systems producer Almaz-Antey, maker of missile launch systems and unguided bombs NPK Tekhmash, producer of the infamous ballistic Iskander missiles Vysokotochniye Kompleksy, along with several over manufacturers that develop rocket launchers, cluster munitions, aircraft, armored vehicles and tanks.

Despite Rosatom\u2019s involvement in illegally occupying Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant since March 2022 and appeals made by Kyiv and NGOs, it has evaded Western sanctions.The U.S. and the EU blackballed Russian oil, natural gas and coal in a move to hinder Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war efforts, but Rosatom has remained out of the sanction crosshairs.The Biden administration reportedly considered sanctioning the Russian nuclear energy giant at the onslaught of the invasion, but ultimately decided against it as the White House looked to find cleaner energy alternatives.

U.S. imports of mineral fuels remained Washington\u2019s top imported good from Russia during the first seven months of the war in Ukraine, but fell by 17 percent from the year prior, accounting for 43 percent of total imports compared to 60 percent in first seven months of 2021, a report by the U.S. Trade Representative said in December 2022.
