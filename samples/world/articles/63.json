It is thought this will make it easier for women to start their own businesses.The government says the employment law will apply to any business with more than 25 employees, but a final decision has not yet been made.Ms Tarawalli said the move was \"important\" but that \"more steps will have to be taken before the country can say fairness has been achieved across the genders\".Discrimination against women in the workplace is a \"big issue,\" according to the minister, and the new law will \"change the status quo,\" she said.For Sierra Leone to become a middle-income country it must engage the 52% of the population who are women in the economy, Ms Tarawalli added.Prior to the law, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency (UNFPA) said that \"progress has been made in expanding opportunities for women and girls\" but warned that \"gender inequality and denial of women's rights are still prevalent at all levels in Sierra Leonean society\".As for gender equality in the continent as a whole, UN Women also says that progress has been made, but \"the majority of women work in insecure, poorly paid jobs, with few opportunities for advancement\".You might also be interested in:Progress made on Afghan women's rights, says UNWhy Kenyan men don't want to share with women The Nigerian women leading the fight for changeSomali feminist: Facebook being used to censor meAround the BBCAfrica Today podcastRelated TopicsSierra LeoneWomen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights in AfricaTop StoriesMachu Picchu shut indefinitely over Peru protestsPublished5 hours agoBrazil's army chief sacked after Congress riotsPublished2 hours agoCanada settles $2.8bn residential schools lawsuitPublished1 hour agoFeaturesJapan was the future but it's stuck in the pastArdern burnout shows toll of stress on world leadersM\u00c3\u00a5neskin show the 'dark side of fame' on new albumWhy Indian epic film RRR is charming the WestWhat weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?Superforecasters: The people who can actually see into the futureRomanian teens explain how Andrew Tate approached themThe secrets of a perfect break-up songShould China worry about its shrinking population?Elsewhere on the BBCThe simple error that 16% of us makeGen Z's latest surprising obsessionA return to old-school Canadian glamourMost Read1Buzz Aldrin marries for the fourth time, aged 932Machu Picchu shut indefinitely over Peru protests3Canada settles $2.8bn residential schools lawsuit4Tennessee fires officials after execution errors5Biden's chief of staff to step down - reports6Japan was the future but it's stuck in the past7Windsor concert to mark King's coronation weekend8Theranos founder attempted to flee US - prosecutors9Dolphins seen in NY river for first time in years10Turkey condemns 'vile' Sweden Quran-burning protestBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.
