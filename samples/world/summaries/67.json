Over the last eight decades, the U.S. has been the world\u2019s largest economy, most influential political entity and most powerful military force.However, economists from other countries are increasingly worried that the country has \u201cweaponized\u201d this position of power in recent years, according to the CBC. The U.S. implements sanctions to punish countries in conflict, threatens to devalue its own currency to win trade wars and leverages it to support its own economy at the expense of the rest of the world.Unsurprisingly, these moves have inspired a backlash from China, Russia and other prominent countries.At the 14th BRICS Summit last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced measures to create a new \u201cinternational currency standard.\u201d Meanwhile, China has been urging oil producers and major exporters to accept yuan for payments.Story continuesThis rebellion against the U.S. dollar could erode some of its influence, but there are reasons to believe the greenback\u2019s dominance will be sustained.Replacing the dollar would be hardThe U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance is underappreciated. As of late-2022, the greenback accounts for 59.79% of total foreign reserves. In comparison, the Euro accounts for 19.66%, while the Chinese renminbi accounts for just 2.76% of global reserves.China could expand its market share by twenty-fold and still lag the U.S. dollar by a wide margin.Put simply, replacing the U.S. dollar in foreign reserves is easier said than done.READ MORE: 4 simple ways to protect your money against white-hot inflation (without being a stock market genius)Other countries have a lot of catching upReserve currency status is closely correlated with the size of the issuing country\u2019s economy. In other words, the largest economy usually has the reserve currency status.During the 19th century, the British pound was the world\u2019s reserve currency because the British Empire\u2019s colonies needed it for trade and commerce. For the past century, the U.S. dollar has dominated because the American economy is the largest by far.China\u2019s growth has slowed down in recent years and some believe it will never overtake the U.S. Meanwhile, Russia was the 11th largest economy before it invaded Ukraine, despite being economically smaller in size than California or Texas alone.And India is growing rapidly, but it would need to grow 628% to match the U.S.\u2019s GDP today. That could take 25 years.America\u2019s economic lead is simply insurmountable.The U.S. will still be OKThe final reason Americans shouldn\u2019t be worried about the dollar losing influence is that the worst-case scenario isn\u2019t so bad. Some analysts believe that the future could be more multilateral.The U.S. may lose influence in some segments of the global economy but not lose dominance everywhere. For instance, the Chinese yuan could become more important for trade and cross-border payments, but the dollar could remain the preferred reserve currency for central banks of developed nations.That\u2019s far from an economic nightmare for Americans.What to read nextYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Here's the golden secret to making your retirement fund as secure as Fort Knox60% of working Americans don\u2019t feel confident they\u2019ll have enough money to retire \u2014 here\u2019s how to protect your assets heading into a recessionThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
