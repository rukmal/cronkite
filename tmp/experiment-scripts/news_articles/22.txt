But as new EVs arrive, loyalty will be tested," the report concludes.The most serious threats are coming from EVs priced below $50,000, "where Tesla does not yet truly compete."Be smart: With the cuts in the U.S., more Tesla models will be eligible for newly revised tax incentives of $7,500 that kicked in Jan. 1 under the Inflation Reduction Act.The credit applies to EVs under $55,000, which means models like the higher-end Model 3 Performance now at $53,990 (down 14% from $62,990) and the long-range all-wheel-drive Model Y at $52,990 (down 20% from $65,990) could be more attractive.Worth noting: Tesla had been raising prices over the past two years as higher inflation increased the cost of its inputs. CEO Elon Musk said last year the company's prices had gotten "embarrassing," and he hoped to bring them down."I think inflation will decline towards the end of the year," he said. "I'm hopeful — and this is not a promise — but I'm hopeful at some point we can reduce prices a little bit."What to watch: Customer loyalty.People who bought their vehicles before the cuts have been lamenting the tens of thousands of dollars in savings they barely missed.Irate customers in China have been demanding rebates and protesting the company in showrooms and distribution centers.One measure of the company's favorability has fallen by 15 percentage points since the start of last year.Our thought bubble, via Axios transportation correspondent Joann Muller: Tesla has just two major arrows in its quiver — the Model 3 and Model Y. And that may not be enough to entice shoppers whose heads may be turned by a far greater number of options from other manufacturers.Go deeper: Tesla stock plunge intensifies outlook divideOur auto expert's picks for best vehicles of the yearAxios on facebookAxios on twitterAxios on linkedinAxios on emailGo deeperNews worthy of your time.Download the appAboutAbout AxiosAdvertise with usCareersEventsAxios on HBOAxios HQPrivacy and termsOnline tracking choicesDo not sell my personal informationContact usSubscribeAxios newslettersAxios ProAxios appAxios podcastsCoursesEarn Axios rewardsAxios
