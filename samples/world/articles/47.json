The report will be delivered to the church\u2019s national assembly, the General Synod, which is meeting in London next month.\u201cWe want to apologize for the ways in which the Church of England has treated LGBTQI+ people \u2013 both those who worship in our churches and those who do not,\u201d the bishops said in a statement. \u201cFor the times we have rejected or excluded you, and those you love, we are deeply sorry. The occasions on which you have received a hostile and homophobic response in our churches are shameful, and for this we repent.\u2019\u2019Nonetheless, the Church of England\u2019s stance that matrimony is restricted to unions between one man and one woman will remain in place. It has instead proposed offering same-sex couples the chance to have a church service with prayers of dedication, thanksgiving or for God\u2019s blessing after they have a civil wedding or register a civil partnership.ADVERTISEMENTSame-sex marriage has been legal in England and Wales since 2013, but the church did not change its teaching when the law changed.ReligionReligious leaders sue to block Missouri's abortion banPriest still missing 6 months after leaving apartmentDora Jean Edwards, mother of Louisiana governor, dies at 87Historic Black churches receive $4M in preservation grantsChurch leaders described the decision on church services as a significant change that acknowledges the lived experience of some faithful Christians. But deep divisions remain, and the bishops acknowledged that some clergy will choose not to use the new prayers to bless the unions of same-sex couples.Among them will be Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the spiritual leader of the Anglican Church. He described the introduction of the prayers as \u201ca moment of joy and celebration\u2033 but said his role in the Anglican communion makes his primary task to work for unity among some 85 million members.\u201cBecause of my pastoral care and responsibility of being a focus of unity for the whole communion ... I will not personally use them in order not to compromise that pastoral care,\u2033 he told reporters.Jayne Ozanne, a prominent campaigner for LGBTQ people in the church, expressed disappointment with the stand of the bishops, arguing that God did not discriminate \u2014 and \u201cneither should we.\u2033\u201cWe\u2019ve had apology after apology after apology, and this one frankly, sounds hollow and cruel,\u2033 Ozanne wrote on Twitter. \u201cBecause if you apologise and then carry on with the abuse, it is akin to domestic abuse. The fact that the bishops don\u2019t see that is what angers me.\u201dAP NEWSTop StoriesVideoContact UsAccessibility StatementCookie SettingsDownload AP NEWSConnect with the definitive source for global and local newsMore from APap.orgAP InsightsAP Definitive Source BlogAP Images SpotlightAP ExploreAP BooksAP StylebookFollow APThe Associated PressAboutContactCustomer SupportCareersTerms & ConditionsPrivacyAll contents \u00a9 copyright 2023 The Associated Press.
