We cannot allow our relatives to die of malnutrition and hunger,\u201d Guajajara tweeted.In December, shortly before being named minister, Guajajara visited the region to denounce an illegal 75-mile road powerful mining mafias had carved out of the 96,650 sq km (37,300 sq mile) territory.Interviewed last week in Bras\u00edlia, she said solving the Yanomami crisis \u2013 which had exposed Yanomami children to horrifying levels of malaria, verminosis, malnutrition and diarrhoea \u2013 was at the top of her in-tray.S\u00f4nia Guajajara, Brazil\u2019s first-ever minister for Indigenous peoples.

A 9.6m-hectare reserve was created to safeguard Yanomami lives.But within a decade the prospectors had returned, with the number reaching new heights during Bolsonaro\u2019s 2019-2022 administration as his anti-environmental rhetoric and policies emboldened rainforest wreckers.Guajajara recognised such an eviction would create an \u201cemergency situation\u201d outside the Yanomami territory, as huge numbers of impoverished garimpeiro (independent prospectors) found themselves out of work.A Yanomami man stands near an illegal gold mine.

We need to punish the politicians and business people who own these mines,\u201d she said.\u201cThese are the ones who must be penalised. The miners are engaged in illegal activity. But often they\u2019re doing it out of necessity rather than because they want to be. So we consider them victims too.\u201dGuajajara said another of her ministry\u2019s priorities would be supporting isolated Indigenous groups in the Amazon\u2019s Javari valley region, where the British journalist Dom Phillips and the Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira were murdered last June while documenting Indigenous efforts to protect the rainforest.Guajajara said that seven months on, the Javari continued to be blighted by \u201cviolence, persecution and murder\u201d despite the domestic and international outcry.Beto Marubo, a Javari leader who was close to Pereira, said there had been little sign of action to protect the region\u2019s Indigenous defenders since the two men were shot on the Itaqua\u00ed River.Marubo predicted the newly created ministry for Indigenous peoples would face major obstacles as it pursued ambitious goals.\u201cWe will have to deal with an extremely conservative congress containing people with absolutely no commitment to Indigenous rights or the environment,\u201d he said.A protest in S\u00e3o Paulo calls for the demarcation of Indigenous land and for justice after the murders of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira.

Sometimes it feels like it\u2019s still a dream,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you look back at the journey we made to reach this point, you see that this didn\u2019t happen by chance \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201dTopicsBrazilIndigenous peoplesAmazon rainforestAmericasLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da SilvanewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
